    <p> Now, please imagine that you have to work with this team on a group project. <br>
        On the next screen, we will show you the payoff table of the Weakest Link Game (as introduced earlier) and ask you to decide how many hours (out of your 40-hour workweek) you would like to allocate to the team project.<br><br>

        Please note that the minimum number of hours contributed by any team member determines the overall success of the projectâ€”and therefore your payoff.<br>
        Depending on the behavior of others, it might be more beneficial to invest more time in the team project or to focus on your individual tasks.
