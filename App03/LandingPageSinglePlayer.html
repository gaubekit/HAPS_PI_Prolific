    You have been flagged as a <b>single player</b> and redirected to this page. <br>
    This could be due to one of the following reasons:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>We were unable to group you within 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>You chose to not extend the waiting period and to skip Stage 2.</li>
        <li>You or one of your team members dropped out during Stage 2.</li>
        <li>You or one of your team members could not see or hear all other participants in the video meeting.</li>
    </ul>


    Unfortunately, we can not assign you bonus payoff for Stage 2.
    However, you will be paid for Stage 1, Stage 3, and potentially receive compensate (e.g. additional wait time, compensation Stage 2).
    We will inform you about your payoff in detail after completing Stage 3.
    <br><br>
    Now, please proceed with Stage 3 of the study.
