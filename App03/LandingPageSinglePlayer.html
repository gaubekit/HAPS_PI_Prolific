    You have been flagged as a single player and redirected to this page. This could be due to one of the following reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>You chose to skip Stage 2 during the waiting period for grouping.</li>
        <li>We were unable to group you with others within 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>You dropped out during Stage 2.</li>
        <li>One of your team members dropped out during Stage 2.</li>
        <li>You or one of your team members could not see or hear all other participants in the video meeting.</li>
    </ul>

    Unfortunately, we cannot assign you additional payout for Stage 2. However, you will be paid for Stage 1 and Stage 3. Further, if you extended your waiting time for Stage 2 and/or spend time in Stage 2, we will compensate you for that.
    The final payout structure will be displayed at the end of Stage 3.
    <br><br>
    Please proceed with Stage 3 of the experiment.
