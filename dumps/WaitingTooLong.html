        Unfortunately, we were unable to match you with two other participants in the last five minutes.

        <p>
            You have now the opportunity to extend your waiting time by an additional 5 minutes and rejoin the waiting page.
            We will compensate you for the additional waiting time. In total, you can extend the waiting time 4 times.

            So far, you have extended the waiting time {{participant.additional_wait_time}} times.

            But please consider whether you have enough time to complete the study when extending the waiting time.
            In case you extend the waiting time, and you are unable to complete this study afterward, we can not pay you.

            If you decide to skip Stage 2 of this study (where you join a team) and continue with Stage 3, or we are unable to match you in the additional waiting time, you will be paid for Stage 1, Stage 3 and additional waiting time.
            <br> We will compensate you for the additional waiting time with a sum of 0,30 GBP each time, up to 4 times.<br/>
