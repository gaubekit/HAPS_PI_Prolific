    This experiment focuses on cooperative behavior in virtual teams and consists of six blocks (a to f) that are illustrated below.
<br/>   <img src="{{ static 'images/overview1.jpg' }}" width="100%" /> <br/><br/>
    At the moment, you are in the first block (a), where we give you a general overview and ask you for your constent.
<br/><br/>
    In block (b) we use questionnaires to assess your Social Value Orientation, general beliefs and video meeting behavior tendencies.
<br/><br/>

    In block (c) we will introduce the Weakest Link Game (a coordination game) which with we measure collaborative behavior in virtual teams. We will make sure that you understand it with comprehension questions.
<br/><br/>
    In block (d) you will join a virtual team with two others. The others will remain unknown to you. If not enough participants show up within 10 minutes, you will proceed with block (e).
    When a team forms, we will show in block (d) all participants how they differ from the rest of their virtual team with respect to video meeting preferences.
    Then, we will ask you to make a choice in the Weakest Link Game with regard to your team. Further, we will ask you why you made this choice.
<br/><br/>
    In block (e) you proceed with the experiment on your own. We collect some demographic data (age, gender), continue with further questions about video meeting behavior preferences and end with a longer (57-items) questionnaire to assess your personality.
<br/><br/>
    At the end (f), we will inform you about your payout. Your payout depend on the following aspects:<br>
     - The choice you and one of the others made in the Social Value Orientation assessment (additional payout).<br>
     - The choices you and the two others made in the Weakest Link Game (additional payout).<br>
     - Whether you failed attention checks (reduces your overall payout).
