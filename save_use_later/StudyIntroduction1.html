Before you join a team with other people on prolific, we would like to introduce the Weakest Link Game.

<br/><br/>
Imagine that you have to work with the two other people over the next week on a joint project in <b>virtual team </b>, meaning that you will have regularly video meetings but also spend hours out of your 40-hour workweek to contribute to the project.

You must choose how to allocate your time between the team projects, and other project.

<br/><br/>
<b>Project A</b>: This project is a <b>team</b> project. The success of this project depends on all members in your virtual team and is calculated by the contribution of the team member who contributes the least.<br/><br/>
<b>Project B</b>: Think of this project as your <b>own</b> project. It has been assigned to you by the firm and you are solely responsible for the success.

<br/><br/>
<b>We will ask you how many hours you allocate to Project A (denoted by h<sub>A</sub>). We also ask the others how many hours they allocate to Project A. Both, your answers and the answers of the others, will affect your payout.</b>
<br/><br/>
The available choices are <b>0 hours, 10 hours, 20 hours, 30 hours, and 40 hours</b>. Your remaining hours will be put towards Project B. For example, if you devote 30 hours to Project A, this means that 10 hours will be put towards Project B.
<br/><br/>On the next page, we will detail the payout structure.
