    You will now continue on your own with Block (e). There is no need to wait for other players.<br>
    We are aware that the next block contains a lot of questions, but we kindly ask you to read them carefully and answer them conscientiously.<br>
    <br>
    Please note that missed attention checks will negatively affect your payoff, as our research depends on consistent and reliable data.<br>
    <br>
    Please answer all questions truthfully. We will not — and cannot — match your answers with your identity.<br>
