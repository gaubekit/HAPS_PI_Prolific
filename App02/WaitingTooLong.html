        Unfortunately, we were not able to match you in the last five minutes with two other participants.

        <p>
            You have now the opportunity to extend your waiting time by additional 5 minutes and rejoin the waiting page.
            We will compensate you for the additional waiting time. In total, you can extend the waiting time 4 times.

            Yet, you have extended the waiting time {{participant.additional_wait_time}} times.

            But please consider whether you have enough time to complete the experiment when extending the waiting time.
            In case you extend the waiting time, and you are not able to complete this study afterward, we can not pay you.

            If you decide to skip Stage 2 of this experiment (where you join a team) and continue with Stage 3, or we are not able to match you in the additional waiting time, you will be paid for Stage 1, Stage 3 and additional waiting time.
