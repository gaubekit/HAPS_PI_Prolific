    Unfortunately, we were unable to gather enough participants within 10 minutes to form a group.<br>
    Therefore, we have forwarded you, and you will receive a compensation of 200 ECU for waiting.<br>
    Since we can't match your SVO answer with someone else's, you will receive the amount you allocated to yourself instead of the amount chosen by another participant.<br>

    You will now continue on your own with Block (e). There is no need to wait for other players.<br>
    We are aware that the next block contains a lot of questions, but we kindly ask you to read them carefully and answer them conscientiously.<br>
    <br><br>
    Please note that missed attention checks will negatively affect your payoff, as our research depends on consistent and reliable data.<br>
    <br><br>
    Please answer all questions truthfully. We will not — and cannot — match your answers with your identity.<br>
