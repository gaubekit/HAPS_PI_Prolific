Additionally, you are between 18 and 65 years old, speak English fluently, have at least 100 previous submissions, and have an approval rate of at least 95%. Furthermore, your residence is in the US and you have not participated in this study before.</p>

    <h4><b>Risks and benefits:</b></h4>
    <p>There are no physical or emotional risks associated with this study that would go beyond the risks of daily life. Your participation may improve remote work and benefit society.</p>

    <h4><b>Confidentiality:</b></h4>
    <p>The information collected in this study may be published in a report or a journal article and presented to interested parties, including possibly, but not exclusively, members of editorial boards or scientific committees. We do not collect your IP address and will delete the Prolific ID from the dataset 10 years after the completion of the study. Other information (e.g., survey responses, time of the survey) will be kept by the researchers and may be used for future studies. In addition to consenting to participate in the study, you will have the opportunity to opt-in to the use of your audio data in research presentations with a scientific audience. If you opt-in, your audio data will be kept by the researchers for an unlimited period of time, otherwise it will be deleted ten years after completion of the study. Upon request, personal data (e.g. audio) will be made available to journal editors and reviewers to verify our statements.</p>
