            Unfortunately, we were unable to match you with two other participants in the last five minutes.
            <br><br>

            You have now the opportunity to extend your waiting time by an additional 5 minutes and rejoin the waiting page.
            In total, you can extend the waiting time 4 times.
            <br><br>

            So far, you have extended the waiting time {{participant.additional_wait_time}} times.
            <br><br>
            The additional waiting time is <u>not included</u> in the initially stated 60 minutes.
            <br><br>
            If you decide to skip Stage 2 (where you form a team) and continue with Stage 3 (where you proceed individually),
            or we are unable to match you in the additional waiting time, you will be paid for Stage 1, Stage 3 and your additional waiting time.
            <br><br>
            We will compensate you for the additional waiting time with Â£0,30 each time, up to 4 times.
        </p>
