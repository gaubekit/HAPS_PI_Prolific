            Unfortunately, we were unable to match you with two other participants in the last five minutes.
            <br><br>

            You have now the opportunity to extend your waiting period by an additional 5 minutes and rejoin the waiting page.
            In total, you can extend the waiting period 4 times.
            <br><br>

            So far, you have extended the waiting period {{ participant.additional_wait_time }} times.
            <br><br>
            The additional waiting time is <u>not included</u> in the initially stated 45 minutes.
            <br><br>
            If you decide to skip Stage 2 (team phase) and continue with Stage 3 (individually) you can't earn a bonus for Stage 2, but receive the rest of the payoff.
            The same applies if we are unable to match you with others after the fourth extension.
            <br><br>
            You will be compensated for the additional waiting time with Â£0,3 each time (5 minutes), up to 4 times.
        </p>
