            Unfortunately, we were unable to match you with two other participants in the last five minutes.
            <br><br>

            You now have the opportunity to extend your waiting time by an additional 5 minutes and rejoin the waiting page.
            In total, you can extend the waiting time 4 times.
            <br><br>

            So far, you have extended the waiting time {{participant.additional_wait_time}} times.
            <br><br>
            The additional waiting time is <u>not included</u> in the initially stated 60 minutes.
            Please only extend the waiting time if you are able to complete the study afterwards, otherwise we are for technical reasons only able to compensate you with £1,50.
            <br><br>
            If you decide to skip Stage 2 (where you form a team) and continue with Stage 3 (where you proceed individually),
            or we are not able to match you in the additional waiting time, you will be paid for Stage 1, Stage 3 and your additional waiting time.
            <br><br>
            We will compensate you for the additional waiting time with £0,60 each time, up to 4 times.
