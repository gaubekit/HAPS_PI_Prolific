    We would like to thank you very much for participating in this study. <br/> <br/>

    In this study, you earned {{ final_payoff }} ECU. <br/> <br/>

    <b>your payoff = (fixed payoff + bonus payoff) * attention check fail cost factor</b><br/> <br/>

    The fixed payoff is {{ fixed_payoff }} ECU <br/> <br/>

    The bonus payoff consists of your earnings in the Social Value Orientation (SVO) Slider and in the Weakest Link Game <br/><br/>
    You allocated in the SVO Slider on average {{ svo_self }} ECU to yourself. <br/>
    Another allocated in the SVO Slider on average {{ svo_other }} ECU to you. <br/><br/>
    You choose in the Weakest Link Game {{ wlg_own_choice }} h and the minimum choice of {{ wlg_min_choice }} was made, which with you earned additional {{ wlg_payoff }} ECU<br/><br/>
    Taken together your bonus payoff sums up to {{ additional_payoff }} ECU.<br/><br/>

    In the questionnaires you failed {{ attention_fail }} out of 4 attention checks. You loose 20% payoff (max 80%) per failed attention check. <br/>
    Your attention fail cost factor (1 - failed checks / 5) is {{ attention_fail_cost }}.
