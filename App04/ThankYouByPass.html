    We would like to thank you very much for participating in this study. <br/> <br/>

    In this study, you earned {{ final_payoff }} ECU. <br/> <br/>

    <b>your payoff = (fixed payoff + bonus payoff) * attention check fail cost factor</b><br/> <br/>

    The fixed payoff is {{ fixed_payoff }} ECU <br/> <br/>

    The bonus payoff consists of your earnings in the Social Value Orientation (SVO) Slider and in the Weakest Link Game <br/><br/>

    Because we were not able to match you with somebody within 10 minutes, you will receive twice your SVO Choice of {{ svo_self }} ECU.
    Instead of the Weakest Link Game payoff you receive 200 ECU as compensation.
    Taken together your bonus payoff sums up to {{ bonus }} ECU.<br/><br/>

    In the questionnaires you failed {{ attention_fail }} out of 4 attention checks. You loose 20% payoff (max 80%) per failed attention check. <br/>
    Your attention fail cost factor (1 - failed checks / 5) is {{ attention_fail_cost }}.
